Iron Relow station Aka Soldering/Desoldering SMD Station

Brilliant project find on youtube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hhL1sXg254&t=1831s
I have made my custom PCB. 
You have to set some #DEFINE to set the heater time and fine tuning the proper temperature. You have to do some trial depemding of solder paste and of iron plate caracteristics.
In my case I have use a chaep heating plate and 138Â°C lead free paste.
Works wery well and I'm pretty ststisfied!
Thanks to Davide Gatti for the video and code!
